# keyboard_macro
This is a simple keyboard macro that I made in python while moderating on Discord. 
This contains some of the reasons that can be used for moderation. 

I have used `keyboard` module which you can find [here](https://github.com/boppreh/keyboard)

## Usage
Make sure to install the `keyboard` package using your terminal
```python 
pip install keyboard
```

To use the macro, press the SPACE key when you enter your abbrevation. This will replace it with the text your provided in code.
Pressing the `Esc` key will stop the macro.

Note, I have included all the reasons **as it is**, so make sure you are cross-verifying to make sure they can be used in your server.
